# python-fortigate-config-parser
A attempt to write a fast and extendable parser for Fortigate Config Files in python with ANTLR.

This program will, for now, only contain a parser; e.g. a way to read Fortigate config and split it into a nested python dict.

The sample config files are borrowed and extended from: https://github.com/Fatal-Halt/FortiGate-Config-Parser
